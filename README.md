# Images and Icons


This repo contains the results of our Dec 11th, 2020 military trailblazer office hours call where we walked through icons and images in salesforce formula fields.

Our basic use case was having an alert icon that could be displayed in a listview or report based on the age of a case.  I.e. a green icon for new cases, yellow for cases older than 5 hours, and a red icon for cases older than 10 hours.

In addition, we also looked at adding images and gifs to salesforce flows, including the ability to add audio.
